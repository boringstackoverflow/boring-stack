title: "The cloud bill is an architecture review"
date: 2026-05-30
summary: "Every line of the actual $5.96/mo bill that runs the boring-stack production. What each line buys, what it would cost on a platform PaaS, and what it tells you about the architecture. The bill is the blast radius in dollars."
draft: false

The whole control plane runs on $5.96 a month.

```
hetzner cx22          $4.59
cloudflare r2         $0.12
boringstack.org dns   $1.25
resend (free tier)    $0.00
────────────────────────────
total                 $5.96/mo
```

That bill runs **two production apps**: `borela.dev` (a babysitter service for SQLite-on-VPS apps — backup verification, restore drills, agent heartbeats) and `api.boringstack.org` (this newsletter backend). Same VPS, different systemd users, different ports, different SQLite files. Adding the second app cost zero dollars.

You can't trace a bug from a Vercel invoice. You can trace one from this.

## $4.59 — Hetzner cx22

One €4.51 (≈$4.59) Hetzner cx22. 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 40 GB SSD. Currently running:

- `caddy` — one process, both domains via virtual hosts
- `borela` — systemd unit, port 8080, `/home/borela/data/borela.db`
- `bsb` — systemd unit, port 8081, `/home/bsb/data/bsb.db`
- `borela-agent` — systemd timer, snapshots both DBs to R2

Two apps. Four processes. One box.

The platform-PaaS equivalent for *one* of these apps — say, Render with a worker service, a Postgres add-on, and a managed Redis — runs $30–80/mo. You pay it per app. So the platform version of this exact setup is **$60–160/mo**, not $4.59.

The architecture lesson: co-tenancy works on a boring stack because every component is a process, not a platform. systemd doesn't care that two apps share a box. Caddy doesn't care. SQLite definitely doesn't care — it's a file. The marginal cost of adding `bsb` next to `borela` was the disk and RAM that weren't being used yet. Roughly zero.

## $0.12 — Cloudflare R2

R2 stores backup snapshots. Both databases together are under 50 MB; we keep ~30 days of snapshots; storage cost rounds to twelve cents.

Egress is **free**, which is the actually-important number on this line. R2 doesn't charge to pull data out, which means a restore drill costs $0 to run. That's not a cost story — it's an availability story. The reason most backup setups quietly atrophy is that the *test* costs money or attention or both. When the test is free and one command, you actually run it.

That's the next issue.

One honest note: `bsb` doesn't ship Litestream. The OSS boring-stack skill still defaults to Litestream for fresh projects, but on this specific VPS, `borela-agent` was already running to back up `borela.dev`'s own DB, so adding a second project block to its config was simpler than standing up a parallel Litestream service. **The bill bends to what's already on the box.** If `borela-agent` weren't here, this line would still be $0.12 of R2 storage — plus a `litestream-bsb.service` doing the same job from a different angle.

## $1.25 — boringstack.org DNS + registrar

Cloudflare registrar at cost. Nothing clever.

The architecture lesson is: this is the only line on the bill you genuinely cannot self-host. Every other line has an opt-out — you could move the VPS, swap object storage providers, run your own MTA. The domain doesn't have an opt-out. Somebody owns the root and you rent a label off of it.

Spend the $15/year. Move on.

## $0.00 — Resend (free tier)

Resend's free tier is 3,000 emails/month, 100/day. We're sending well under that — confirmation flow plus a handful of newsletter issues per month, to a small audience. The free tier covers our year-one needs roughly 100x over.

The architecture lesson: most managed services have a free tier that's bigger than your year-one needs. Use them. Don't apologize. Don't run your own SMTP server because of a principle. Save the principle for the place it matters — the database, the part that owns user data, the part that has to survive a vendor bankruptcy. Email isn't that.

## What's not on the bill

| Component                       | This stack | Platform equivalent |
|---------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Object cache (Redis)            | $0 — SQLite is fast enough | $10–25/mo |
| Queue (Sidekiq, SQS, etc.)      | $0 — in-process worker tick | $5–20/mo  |
| Observability (logs, metrics)   | $0 — `journalctl` + free-tier uptime check | $20–100/mo |
| CI / build / deploy             | $0 — `make build && scp && systemctl restart` from a laptop | $0–50/mo |
| Application hosting             | (counted in $4.59) | $25/mo per app |

Four lines that aren't there because the architecture doesn't have somewhere to put them. There's no Redis line because there's no Redis. There's no CI line because the deploy is a shell script. The bill isn't smaller because we're cheap. It's smaller because **there are fewer components**.

## The actual lesson

Every line on your bill is a component you'll have to debug at 3am someday.

The bill is the blast radius in dollars.

A $6/mo bill has a 4-component blast radius: VPS, object storage, registrar, email. Pick a problem and you can be reading the right log file in under sixty seconds.

A $200/mo bill has a 30-component blast radius: PaaS host, managed Postgres, managed Redis, a queue, a CDN, a log aggregator, an APM, a feature-flag service, an auth provider, a transactional mailer, a marketing mailer, a status page, a CI runner, a container registry, an error tracker, and so on. Pick a problem and you have to figure out which dashboard owns it before you can look at it.

Bugs scale with components, not with traffic. A small app on a small bill has a small bug surface *by construction*. That's not frugality. That's an architecture choice expressed as a dollar amount.

## The deal, again

This is issue #5. Next Tuesday: the **first restore drill** — actually pulling the SQLite DB out of R2 onto a fresh box and proving the backup works. Stopwatch and screenshots.

Boring is not free. Boring is *cheap and small enough to fit in your head*.
